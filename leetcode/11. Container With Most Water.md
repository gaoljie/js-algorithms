Given _n_ non-negative integers _a1_, _a2_, ..., _an_ , where each represents a point at coordinate (_i_, _ai_). _n_ vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line _i_ is at (_i_, _ai_) and (_i_, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and _n_ is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

**Solution:**

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxArea = function(height) {
  var length = height.length;
  var start = 0;
  var end = length - 1;
  var max = 0;

  while (start != end) {
    var min;
    if (height[start] < height[end]) {
      min = height[start];
      start++;
    } else {
      min = height[end];
      end--;
    }

    var size = min * (end - start + 1);
    if (size > max) max = size;
  }

  return max;
};
```
